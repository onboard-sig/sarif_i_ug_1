It has to be set by the user.

For recent releases, a temporary directory by created by making a directory called work in the `${jetty.base}` directory (the parent directory of the webapps directory). Alternately the java temporary directory can be set with the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. A more detailed description of how jetty selects a temporary directory is below.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability the directory must be set to one that is not writable by an attacker.
